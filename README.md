## 🧠 What I Learned
As a beginner in Python and Data Analysis, this project taught me:
- Writing structured Python code and functions  
- Handling file I/O using the CSV module  
- Performing data aggregation with Pandas  
- Creating visual insights using Matplotlib  
- Designing menu-driven CLI apps

## 🚧 Limitations
- Data is stored locally in `.csv` format only  
- No persistent database or login system  
- Graph shows only **monthly totals**

## 🌱 Future Improvements
- Allow editing/deleting of expense entries  
- Add category-wise pie chart visualization  
- Export summary to Excel or PDF  
- Build a GUI using **Tkinter** or **Streamlit**
