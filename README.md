## 🧠 What I Learned  
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:  
- Writing clean and modular Python code  
- Working with file input/output using the CSV module  
- Aggregating and analyzing data using **Pandas**  
- Visualizing insights through **Matplotlib**  
- Building interactive, menu-driven CLI applications  
- Implementing edit/delete functionality for real-world usability

## 🚧 Limitations  
- Data is stored locally in `.csv` format only  
- No persistent database or login system  
- Graphs currently limited to **monthly totals** and **category breakdowns**
